This repository demonstrates a common issue in TypeScript where type coercion can lead to runtime errors that are not caught during compilation.  The `bug.ts` file shows the problematic code, where a function expecting numbers is called with a string. TypeScript's type system doesn't prevent this, resulting in a runtime error. The solution in `bugSolution.ts` demonstrates how to address this by using stricter type guards or type assertions to avoid this kind of unexpected behavior.  This is a subtle but important consideration when writing TypeScript code to prevent unexpected runtime issues.
